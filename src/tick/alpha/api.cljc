;; Parsing

(def ^{:doc "Do not use this function if you know the expected format of the string
that you want to parse. This is partly because for example t/instant, t/date etc  will
be much faster, but also because if the string you pass it is not in the format you
expect, this function may still convert it into some entity that you weren't expecting.

If you have a string in a non-standard format, use a formatter and the parse fn of they entity you want.

For example:

(cljc.java-time.local-date/parse \"20200202\" (t/formatter \"yyyyMMdd\"))
"} parse p/parse)
